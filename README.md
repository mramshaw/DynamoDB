![AWS DynamoDB](images/Database_AmazonDynamoDB.png)

Having previously used AWS DynamoDB for [Alexa](http://github.com/mramshaw/Alexa-Stuff/tree/master/DynamoDB),
it seemed to be time to investigate DynamoDB as a NoSQL database in its own right.

## To Do

- [ ] Install billing alerts
- [ ] Investigate IAM and RBAC
- [ ] Investigate auto-scaling
- [ ] Investigate [Global Tables](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/)
